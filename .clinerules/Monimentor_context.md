Monimentor
Raising a digitally resilient generation
healthy
happy
Hello. We are Maarten Nijhuis and Bas Beelen, and we're the founders of Monimentor. As fathers and technologists, we are personally living the problem we're here to solve. For the 900,000 families in the Netherlands with primary school children, the daily 'screen battle' has become a source of conflict and anxiety.
Today, we're going to show you how Monimentor moves beyond crude screen time controls to build something far more valuable: digital resilience.


Our vision
We envision a world where every child confidently navigates the digital world with a sense of wonder and wisdom. 
Our mission is to learn children the skills needed for this journey, moving families from digital anxiety to shared discovery. This path is about empowering children to live a happy healthy life.

Our vision begins with a shift in perspective. The digital world isn't a threat that can be locked away; it's a new frontier for growth and creativity that demands a new skill: resilience. Our mission is to move families from the daily "screen battle" to "healthy digital habits" and, ultimately, to a child's self-governed "digital freedom." This journey is about empowering children to become masters of their digital world, not slaves to it.


The problem
The problem is a three-way digital crisis, felt by our children, their parents, and our society.
For Children: They're in an unfair fight. Their brains are wired for immediate reward, but they lack the self-control to resist platforms engineered for addiction. Being offline often means social exclusion.
For Parents: They're exhausted and feel guilty. They're trapped between the daily conflict of saying "no" and the anxiety of giving in. They feel outmatched by a digital world they weren't trained for.
For Society: A twofold crisis. There is clear academic consensus on the harmful effects this crisis is having physically, cognitively and socially. Simultaneously, the over-stimulation from screens erodes critical skills like focus and impulse control, risking a generation ill-equipped to navigate a complex world of misinformation.
"The 'screen time problem' isn't one problem; it's a three-way crisis.
For our kids, it's an unfair fight. Their brains are built for fun, not for brakes, making them vulnerable to platforms engineered for addiction.
For parents, it's a daily battle for peace. They feel lost, guilty, and completely outmatched.
And for society, this has led to a crisis with clear, evidence-backed consequences. There is now widespread academic consensus on the harmful effects. Physically, we are seeing documented public health epidemics in youth myopia, obesity, and sleep disorders. Cognitively, over-stimulation from screens is eroding critical skills like focus and impulse control, creating what researchers call a 'fragmented brain' and risking a generation ill-equipped to navigate a complex world. This isn't just about managing a household nuisance; it's about addressing a fundamental challenge to our children's future well-being."


The solution
Monimentor is an intelligent, compassionate platform that acts as a personal digital mentor for the whole family.

We go beyond restricting screen time; we empower. We guide children along a personalized "Digital Freedom Path," building the behavioral skills they need to thrive online, independently.

We move families from conflict to confidence by reframing the goal: you're not taking something away; you're giving your child the gift of self-mastery.
Our ultimate goal is to learn the skills needed to live a healthy digital life.
Existing solutions see this as a battle to be won with more control. We see it as a generation that needs to be empowered with better skills. This is the Monimentor reframe.
We are creating a new category we call 'Digital Mentorship'. Our platform is built around the 'Digital Freedom Path'—a journey of mastering skills and habits. Progress is measured by our proprietary 'Digital Resilience Score,' or DRS. As a child's DRS improves, they earn more freedom and trust. This entire journey is facilitated by Moni, the friendly face of the system, who acts as the child's personal guide.


We are at the center of a perfect storm. The time is now.
Urgent Need: Screen time for young children has doubled in ten years. Children aged 8-10 now average 5.5 hours per day, far exceeding the recommended 1.5 hours. Parental anxiety is at an all-time high.
Market Dissatisfaction: Existing solutions are blunt instruments. Parents and children see them as negative, restrictive, and a source of family conflict. They manage the clock; they don't build the skill.
Cultural Shift: There is a massive societal demand for a more positive, educational approach to digital parenting. Parents don't want to be guards; they want to be guides.
Market validation / Why now
So, why is now the perfect time for Monimentor?
First, the need is more urgent than ever. Research shows that secondary school students are already on their smartphones for hours a day, more than they ever where, but more importantly what they do on these screens has become of low quality, fed by algorithms that fight for their attention.
Second, the market is deeply dissatisfied. Current tools are negative and create friction.
And third, the culture is shifting. Parents are tired of being the police. They are actively seeking solutions that align with a positive, coaching-based parenting philosophy. Monimentor is perfectly positioned to define and lead this new category of digital mentorship.

The Product
Monimentor teaches skills through an "invisible playground," making learning contextual and effective.
It works in four simple, adaptive steps:
Observe: Monimentor’s Intelligence Core identifies a child's current state or a "Behavioral Signature"—a pattern showing the child is ready for a new skill (e.g., exploring ad-heavy content).
Guide: If guidance is needed Moni, the digital guide, introduces a relevant micro-lesson from the "Digital Freedom Path," like "Spotting Hidden Ads".
Empower: The child masters the skill through a quick challenge or by demonstrating the behavior in their real-world digital activity.
Reward: The child's Digital Resilience Score (DRS) increases, unlocking more freedom and trust within the app.
So how does it actually work? Our learning model is built on an 'Observe-First' philosophy. We want to recognize and reward positive behavior organically.
Let’s take an example: the 'Spotting Hidden Ads' skill for a 7-year-old.
First, our system OBSERVES a behavioral signature: the child starts watching a lot of 'toy unboxing' videos. This is a predictive trigger that the skill of identifying native advertising is now highly relevant.
Our preferred path is mastery through recognition. The system sees the child watch a similar video and close it when a clear ad appears. Moni then appears to GUIDE and REWARD this behavior: 'Great job! You spotted an ad all by yourself! +150 DRS!'.
But if that doesn't happen, we have a backup. If the child repeatedly clicks on in-video ads, Moni will introduce a supportive micro-challenge to EMPOWER them. It might be a short clip where Moni asks, 'What is the creator really doing here? A) Showing a cool toy, or B) Trying to get you to spend money?'. Correct answers earn DRS points and a badge. This is our 'invisible playground' in action.
With our solution children have something to ‘win’ instead of loosing, they win autonomy and freedom if they show they have the skill and can handle the responsibility. With freedom comes responsibility (Eleanor Roosevelt)


The Monimentor Intelligence Core

Our platform is powered by an adaptive, three-engine core that personalizes each child's journey toward digital independence.
This intelligent core makes Monimentor a life coach, not just a library of content.
The Digital Nutrition Engine (The "What"): Assesses the quality of a child's "digital diet," classifying content as 'Brain Food,' 'Fun Food,' or 'Empty Calories'. It moves beyond counting minutes to understanding the value of their screen time.
The Resilience Engine (The "How"): Our core IP. It predictively teaches skills by identifying "Behavioral Signatures" —patterns that show a child is ready for a new lesson—and recognizes when they demonstrate mastery in their real-world digital activity.
The Social Intelligence Engine (The "Who"): Analyzes metadata and patterns to distinguish healthy online connections from risky environments, building crucial social wisdom in a privacy-first way.
Let's look under the hood. The brain of our platform is the Intelligence Core, which personalizes each child's journey.
At its heart is the Digital Resilience Score, or DRS. This isn't just a simple timer. It's a holistic, dynamic score measuring a child's digital maturity across four key pillars:
Healthy Habits, Mastered Skills, Social Wisdom, and Family Partnership.
The DRS is powered by three engines. The
Nutrition Engine assesses the 'what'—the quality of their digital diet. The
Resilience Engine teaches the 'how'—using our proprietary curriculum and behavioral recognition to build skills. And the
Social Intelligence Engine addresses the 'who'—helping children navigate online social environments safely and positively.


Our technology & traction
We’ve de-risked the core technology by building a working PoC, learning from it, and pivoting to a superior, scalable architecture.
This demonstrates our ability to execute, learn, and innovate quickly.
Initial MVP & Key Learnings: Our first version, built on open-source VPN tech, proved we could capture valuable event data. However, it also revealed critical flaws: true VPNs are easily blocked by services like Netflix and are expensive to scale.
The Pivot to Our Core IP: We've pivoted to build our proprietary solution: a custom, OS-independent 'client/device engine'. This engine solves all the previous limitations, creates a seamless single native app experience, and forms the defensible heart of our technology.
An idea is only as good as the team's ability to execute. We have moved quickly to de-risk this opportunity.
We self-funded and built an initial PoC using open-source tools like Wireguard and mitmproxy. This worked—it proved we could generate actionable insights from network traffic. But it also taught us what
doesn't work at scale.
So, we pivoted. We are now building our core IP, a custom client engine that is more robust, seamless, and scalable. We have proven the feasibility by integrating the engine into our iOS app. The core business logic is currently being built and verified.
This isn't our first time building a complex platform. As a team, we previously built a payment orchestration platform for the African market in under a year, which resulted in a 26% conversion uplift for our client. We know how to build, pivot, and deliver.

Business model
We make money through a simple, scalable Freemium model.
Our goal is to make healthy digital habits accessible to everyone.
Free Version: Core features for monitoring and basic guidance are free to drive mass adoption and establish Monimentor as the standard and learn the algorithms.
Premium Subscription: €70 / year / family, Unlocks the full, adaptive Digital Freedom Path, personalized coaching from Moni, and advanced family insights.
Our go-to-market is built around a Freemium model, designed for rapid adoption and validation.
The free version is our Trojan horse. It allows us to launch into our beachhead communities, acquire our first 1,000 families, and prove the core value proposition with minimal friction.
Once families see the positive change, we offer an upgrade to our Premium subscription for €xx per year. This unlocks the full power of the platform, including the entire adaptive curriculum and personalized insights. This model allows us to obsessively measure activation and engagement to validate our flywheel before scaling aggressively.


Go-to-market strategy
Our plan is to win a focused "beachhead" and then scale the playbook.
Launch (Year 1): Target one or two tech-forward Dutch cities (e.g., Eindhoven, Utrecht). We will use lightweight promotion through trusted school channels (newsletters, parent evenings) to acquire our first 1,000 families.
Scale (Year 2-3): Take the proven playbook from our beachhead and apply it nationwide to become the Dutch category leader.
Expand (Year 3+): Replicate the model in our first international market (Germany), securing a high-profile launch partner to build instant credibility.

Existing solutions are stuck in the past, competing on control. We are creating a new category based on empowerment.
We are uniquely positioned in the "Empowerment & Dynamic" quadrant. While others sell restriction, we build resilience.

Competitive Landscape & Our Unique Advantage
The market is fragmented into three primary categories. Monimentor is the only solution that integrates the best of all three in a single, intelligent platform.
1. The Free Blockers (Google Family Link, Apple Screen Time)
Their Approach: Basic, blunt instruments (time limits, app blocking) that focus only on the quantity of screen time.
Our Advantage: We focus on the quality of digital engagement. They manage the clock; we build the skill.
2. The Premium Enforcers (e.g., Qustodio)
Their Approach: Feature-heavy parental control and surveillance rooted in a philosophy of restriction.
Our Advantage: Our core philosophy is empowerment over enforcement. They sell control; we build confidence.
3. The Educational Content Providers (e.g., ChatLicense)
Their Approach: Valuable but static information provided through preset content and games, disconnected from a child's real-time behavior.
Our Advantage: We build instinctive skills through our predictive, "Context-Relevant" learning model. They are a library; we are a live coach

Competitive Advantage
Our unfair advantages create a defensible moat.
The Intelligence Core: First-of-its-kind system that focuses on how a child behaves, not just how long. Our "Context-Relevant Learning" model is our core IP.
Positive Psychology: We are a coach, not a cop. This positive framing reduces family friction, leading to higher engagement and retention than our competitors.
The Community Flywheel: Our feedback system, which prioritizes input from users with high Digital Resilience Scores, creates a self-improving platform that gets smarter with every family that joins.
Founder-Market Fit: We are fathers and technologists. We live the problem and have the deep technical expertise to build the solution.
Our advantages are deeply embedded in our product and philosophy. They aren't just features; they are reflections of our core beliefs, what we call the 'Monimentor Manifesto'.
We believe in Empowerment, Not Enforcement. We provide the training wheels, not the cage.
We believe Resilience is a Learned Skill, not an on/off switch. Our platform is an 'invisible playground' for children to build the critical thinking muscles they need.
And we believe Every Child's Journey is Unique. A child's readiness for freedom is measured by their demonstrated maturity, not just their age. This philosophy is our moat."

The Monimentor Manifesto: Our Core Beliefs
This is our north star. It guides every product decision, every line of code, and every conversation we have with families.
We Believe in Empowerment, Not Enforcement. Our role is to be a guide, not a guard. We provide the training wheels, not the cage.
We Believe Resilience is a Learned Skill, Not an On/Off Switch. Our platform is an "invisible playground" for children to build the emotional and critical thinking muscles they need to thrive.
We Believe Every Child's Journey is Unique. A child's readiness for freedom is measured by their demonstrated maturity, not just their age. Our system adapts to the individual child's pace.
We Believe We are Partners to Parents, Not Replacements. Our technology is designed to strengthen the parent-child bond by fostering conversation and shared understanding.
We Believe in Fostering Active Digital Engagement, Not Passive Consumption. We champion a "digital diet" rich in conscious choice and active participation, empowering children to use technology as a tool for their own goals, not just as a source of mindless consumption.
We Believe This Mission is Non-Negotiable. The challenge of raising a healthy generation in this new digital world is monumental. The cost of inaction is unacceptable. We choose to act.
